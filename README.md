Module 4 Challenge

## Overview of the school district analysis: 
This analysis will provide a high-level snapshot of the district performance on the state mandated testing in reading and math for high schools. From a district level, personnel will be able to use this data to view the highest and lowest performing schools and draw conclusions about student performance in relation to school budget, size, and type. There seemed to be irregularities in the testing data from one grade at one school and in how the students names were reported. The data was cleaned and comparisons will be made between the data before the analysis and after. 

## Results: 
#### (Overall effects of nullifying all 9th grade Math and Reading scores from Thomas High School)
- How is the district summary affected?
The total number of students analyzed in this report was decreased by 461, the total number of Thomas High School students that completed the yearly testing. To notice any change in the percent of students passing math, reading or both, the decimal places displayed had to be increased. However, there was a slight increase in all categories of the students passing (<= .3% change).

- How is the school summary affected?

The only school affected was Thomas High School. However, its standing within other schools, namely the charter schools was greatly affected. Before replacing all 9th grade scores, Thomas High School's overall averages for Math were average among District schools but had ~25% less students pass the test than most Charter Schools. The indicator that something was wrong was that the percent of students passing the Reading test was much lower than any other school.

- After replacing the scores, Thomas High School moves from the lowest performing charter school to fourth highest overall (out of 8, 15 total schools)

#### Replacing the ninth-grade scores affects:
- Math and reading scores by grade: No other scores - schools or grades - were affected on the Scores by Grade charts
- Scores by school spending: Thomas High School falls in the $631-$645 category of budgeting per student. The other three schools in that category are district schools. So, changing the scores slightly increased that category's percent passing figures, but not greatly.
- Scores by school size: The other four schools in the 1000-1999 category of school size are charter schools. The percent passing slightly increased in all three, math, reading, and both, most in reading. 
- Scores by school type: Before changing the scores, Thomas High School was the only underperforming charter school. So, these percents were affected more than the charts by size, grade, or spending. However, it was still a slight change overall for the district perspective.

## Summary: 
- The overall number of students' test scores analyzed decreased by 461 9th grade students from Thomas High School.
- The percent of students passing the math test was average among district schools before the change, lower than any charter school. After the change, it was average among other charter schools' passing rate and average score.
- The percent of students passing the reading test was the lowest of any school before replacing the scores. However, after, it was equal to the other highest performing schools. 
- The overall percent of students passing both tests was much higher than any district school before the replacement scores were put in (65% versus <55%) despite similar levels in other categories. This must be examined more closely. After the change, again, it was equal to other top performing charter schools overall. 
- Replacing this many scores (1.2% of total students) impacted the district data very slightly. However, it greatly impacted the consequences to Thomas High School. They would receive similar benefits as all other charter schools by this analysis. But, at what cost to the school and the inordinate amount of students that did not pass? Will they receive the extra attention needed to help struggling students? Who in the school is responsible for this irregularity - was it teacher error while testing, due to the student population, a worldwide pandemic, or another factor? Someone is covering this story and will provide an update on next week's news.
